# Asana API


## Authentication
Authenticated through basic OAuth. This will work much like our Harvest Implemenation. We will need to check against the token for expiry first before making our api calls.

### User Authorization Endpoint

#### Redirect users to request Asana access
`GET https://app.asana.com/-/oauth_authorize`

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
client_id | required The Client ID uniquely identifies the application making the request.
redirect_uri | required The URI to redirect to on success or error. This must match the Redirect URL specified in the application settings.
response_type | required Must be one of either code (if using the Authorization Code Grant flow) or token (if using the Implicit Grant flow). Other flows are currently not supported.
state | required Encodes state of the app, which will be returned verbatim in the response and can be used to match the response up to a given request.

#### Response

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
code | If response_type=code in the request, this is the code your app can exchange for a token
token | If response_type=token in the request, this is the token your app can use to make requests of the API
state | The state parameter that was sent with the authorizing request

### Token Exchange Endpoint

#### Request
`POST https://app.asana.com/-/oauth_token`

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
grant_type | required One of authorization_code, refresh_token or password. See below for more details.
client_id | required The Client ID uniquely identifies the application making the request.
client_secret | required The Client Secret belonging to the app, found in the details pane of the developer console.
redirect_uri | required Must match the redirect_uri specified in the original request.
code | sometimes required If grant_type=authorization_code this is the code you are exchanging for an authorization token.
refresh_token | sometimes required If grant_type=refresh_token this is the refresh token you are using to be granted a new access token.
username | sometimes required If grant_type=password this is the username you are exchanging for an authorization token.

#### Response
Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
access_token | The token to use in future requests against the API
expires_in | The number of seconds the token is valid, typically 3600 (one hour)
token_type | The type of token, in our case, bearer
refresh_token | If exchanging a code, a long-lived token that can be used to get new access tokens when old ones expire.
